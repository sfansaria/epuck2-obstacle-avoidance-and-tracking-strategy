# epuck2-obstacle-avoidance-and-tracking-strategy


Task 1   
Design, implement and test a control strategy for an e-puck2 robot
● to explore a bounded environment with obstacles.
● to avoid any collision with the environment boundary or obstacles.
Task 2
Design, implement and test a control strategy for the e-puck2 robot
● to chase an object in an open environment that is free of obstacles.
● to avoid any collision with the object.

Your control strategy must be executed directly on-board the e-puck2 robot. A key challenge
will be to cope with the inherent uncertainties of real robots.
For example, the laboratory has windows and hence the level of ambient light, and the sensor reading values, may
depend on weather conditions. A good strategy (and implementation) can be adapted
reasonably fast to changing levels of ambient light.
